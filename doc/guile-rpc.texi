@chapter Introduction

GNU Guile-RPC is a framework for distributed programming under GNU
Guile.  It is a pure Scheme implementation of the ONC RPC standard,
i.e., the ``Open Network Computing'' Remote Procedure Call standard.
ONC RPC is standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as
RFC 1831.  It is based on the External Data Representation standard
(XDR), known as RFC 4506 (@pxref{References}).

@cindex marshalling
@cindex distributed programming
Remote procedure calls allow programs on different, potentially remote
machines to interact together.  A @dfn{remote procedure call} is the
invocation of the procedure of a program located on a remote host (the
@dfn{RPC server}), as the name implies.  Doing so requires the
procedure arguments on the client-side to be encoded, or
@dfn{marshalled}, i.e., converted to a representation suitable for
transfer over the network.  On the server-side, upon reception of the
RPC, those arguments must be decoded or @dfn{unmarshalled}, i.e.,
converted back to a form that is directly understandable by the server
program---for instance, data using Scheme data types, should the
server program be written in Scheme.  The value returned by the RPC
server must be encoded and decoded similarly.

When using the ONC RPC protocol, the way data items are encoded is
dictated by the XDR standard.  This encoding has the advantage of being
particularly compact, allowing for relatively low bandwidth requirements
and fast implementations, especially compared to more verbose RPC
protocols such as XML-RPC and SOAP.

The XDR encoding is not @dfn{self-describing}, i.e., it is impossible
given an arbitrary XDR encoded sequence to determine the XDR type of the
encoded data.  This is different from
@uref{http://dbus.freedesktop.org/, D-Bus}, for example, which uses a
compact and self-describing encoding.  In practice, this is sufficient
for a wide range of applications.

GNU Guile-RPC provides an easy access to the ONC RPC protocol for the
Guile Scheme programmer.  In particular, it allows standard Scheme
types to be mapped to XDR data types, so that Scheme objects are
easily encoded to or decoded from XDR.

@chapter Obtaining and Installing GNU Guile-RPC

The GNU Guile-RPC web page is located at
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile-rpc/}.  You can obtain copy of
GNU Guile-RPC from @uref{ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guile-rpc/}.

In order to use GNU Guile-RPC, all that is needed is
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html, GNU Guile 1.8}
along with the R6RS library package for Guile 1.8, known as
@uref{http://www.laas.fr/~lcourtes/software/guile/guile-r6rs-libs-0.0.tar.gz,
@code{guile-r6rs-libs}}@footnote{Hopefully, this package will be
integrated into core Guile when the final @uref{http://www.r6rs.org/,
R6RS Standard} is accepted.}.

As of this writing, Guile 1.8 does not contain an implementation of
@uref{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-35/srfi-35.html, SRFI-35}.  Thus,
you may need to install @uref{http://home.gna.org/guile-lib/,
Guile-Lib}, which contains the relevant module.


@c *********************************************************************

@chapter Quick Start

Currently, Guile-RPC lacks a compiler for the XDR and RPC languages.
So one has to write data type and RPC definitions ``by hand'', using
the Guile-RPC's programming interface.  Hopefully, this should be
quite straightforward.

Consider the following RPC definitions:

@example
typedef struct
@{
  int          integer_part;
  unsigned int decimal_part;
@} result_t;

program ARITHMETIC_PROGRAM
@{
  version ARITHMETIC_VERSION
  @{
    /* Return the integer and decimal part of NUMBER.  */
    result_t split_number (double number) = 1;
  @} = 0;
@} = 80000;
@end example

This defines a simple RPC @dfn{interface} named @code{ARITHMETIC}
which contains only one procedure called @code{split_number ()}.  The
interface itself has a @dfn{program number} that identifies it (here,
80000).  Normally, program numbers below 20000000 (hexadecimal) are
assigned by Sun Microsystems, Inc. and thus should not be used unless
the number has been properly registered (@pxref{References, RFC 1831},
for details).  It also has a @dfn{version number} (here, 0) that is
user-defined and should be increased when the interface changes (e.g.,
when procedures are added, modified, etc.).  Finally, the procedure
@code{split_number ()} has a procedure number (here, 1) that allows it
to be distinguished from other procedures.

People vaguely familiar with the C programming language should have
guessed by now that this simple interface defines a procedure that
takes a double-precision floating-point number and returns a structure
that contains two fields.

Client and server creation are two-step.  Since the first step---data
type definition---is the same for both, that leaves us with a total of
three steps, described below.

@menu
* Defining Data Types::         Defining RPC data types
* Creating the Client::         Creating the RPC client
* Creating the Server::         Creating the RPC server
@end menu

More details about the XDR type definition as well as client and
server creation are available in the API reference (@pxref{API
Reference}).


@node Defining Data Types, Creating the Client, Quick Start, Quick Start
@subsection Defining Data Types

Before actually creating a client or server for this interface, one
must define the types it uses.  To that end, one must first import the
relevant Guile-RPC modules:

@example
(use-modules (rpc xdr)
             (rpc xdr types))
@end example

Then, the @code{result_t} type must be defined:

@example
(define result-type
  (make-xdr-struct-type (list xdr-integer             ;; `integer_part'
                              xdr-unsigned-integer))) ;; `decimal_part'
@end example

@node Creating the Client, Creating the Server, Defining Data Types, Quick Start
@subsection Creating the Client

Producing a client to invoke @code{split_number ()} is as simple as
this:

@example
(use-modules (rpc rpc))

(define invoke-split-number
  (make-synchronous-rpc-call 80000 0    ;; program and version
                             1          ;; procedure number
                             xdr-double ;; argument type
                             result-type))
@end example

Once this is done, invoking the procedure is as simple as this:

@example
(invoke-split-number 3.14 #x7777 socket)
@end example

@cindex transaction ID (xid)

The first argument to @code{invoke-split-number} is the argument of
@code{split_number ()}; the second argument is a transaction ID, i.e.,
an arbitrarily chosen number that identifies the remote procedure
call; the third argument should be an output port, typically one
bound to a connection to the RPC server:

@example
(define socket (socket PF_INET SOCK_STREAM 0))
(connect socket AF_INET INADDR_LOOPBACK 6666)
@end example

This example creates an IPv4 connection to the local host on port 6666
(@pxref{Network Sockets and Communication,,, guile, The GNU Guile
Reference Manual}).

On success, @code{invoke-split-number} returns a two-element list
where the first element corresponds to the @code{integer_part} field
of the result and the second element correspond to the
@code{decimal_part} field of the result, both represented as Scheme
exact integers.

@node Creating the Server,  , Creating the Client, Quick Start
@subsection Creating the Server

Creating a TCP server for our RPC interface should be quite easy as
well.  We can re-use our previous type definitions (@pxref{Defining
Data Types}).  Then, all we have to do is to create a definition for
our program.

@example
(use-modules (rpc rpc server))

(define (split-number-handler number)
  ;; Handle a `split-number' request.
  (let* ((int (floor number))
         (dec (floor (* 1000 (- number int)))))
    (list (inexact->exact int)
          (inexact->exact dec))))

(define my-rpc-program
  ;; Define our RPC program.
  (let* ((proc (make-rpc-procedure number xdr-double result-type
                                   split-number-handler))
         (version (make-rpc-program-version 0 (list proc))))
    (make-rpc-program 80000 (list version))))

;; Creating a listening TCP socket.
(define server-socket (socket PF_INET SOCK_STREAM 0))

;; Listen for connections on 127.0.0.1, port 6666.
(bind server-socket AF_INET INADDR_LOOPBACK 6666)
(listen server-socket 1024)

;; Go ahead and serve requests.
(run-stream-rpc-server (list (cons server-socket my-rpc-program))
                       1000000 ;; a one-second timeout
                       #f      ;; we don't care about closed connections
                       (lambda () ;; our idle thunk
                         (format #t "one second passed~%")))
@end example

And now we're all set: We have a working TCP client and server for
this wonderful RPC interface!  This would work similarly for other
stream-oriented transports such as Unix-domain sockets: only the
@code{socket} and @code{bind} calls need to be adapted.

Guile-RPC makes use of the
@uref{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-34/srfi-34.html, SRFI-34 exception
mechanism} along with
@uref{http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-35/srfi-35.html, SRFI-35 error
conditions} to deal with the various protocol errors@footnote{Guile
1.8 provides an implementation of the former in the @code{(srfi
srfi-34)} module, while the latter is currently provided by the
@uref{http://home.gna.org/guile-lib/, @code{guile-lib} package}.}.
Thus, users are expected to use these mechanisms to handle the error
conditions described in the following sections.  Hopefully, in most
cases, error conditions raised by Guile-RPC code provide users
with detailed information about the error.

data to Scheme values.

@node XDR Type Representations, XDR Standard Data Types, Implementation of XDR, Implementation of XDR
@subsection XDR Type Representations

@cindex XDR type objects

The XDR standard defines various basic data types and allows for the
definition of compound data types (``structs''), fixed-size and
variable-size arrays as well as ``unions''.  Fixed-size arrays and
structs can actually be thought as the same type: Their size if known
in advance and they are encoded as the succession of the data they
contain.  Thus, those types can be summarized as 4 great classes:
``basic'' types, variable-length arrays, structs and unions.

The @code{(rpc xdr)} module provides facilities to represent and
handle these classes of types which we describe below.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-basic-type name size type-pred encoder decoder [vector-encoder [vector-decoder]]
This returns an @code{<xdr-basic-type>} object describing a type whose
encoding fits on @var{size} octets, and which is encoded/decoded using
the @var{encoder} and @var{decoder} procedures.  @var{type-pred}
should be a predicate checking the validity of an input Scheme value
for encoding into this type.

Optionally, @var{vector-encoder} and @var{vector-decoder} can be passed
and should be procedures that efficiently encode/decode sequences of
data items of this type (for instance, the vector decoder could use the
@code{bytevector->int-list} procedure of the @code{(r6rs bytevector)}
module to speed up decoding).  The vector encoder is invoked as
@code{(@var{vector-encoder} type value bv index)} while the vector
decoder is invoked as @code{(@var{vector-decoder} type count port)}.

Users should normally not need to define new basic types since all the
basic types defined by XDR are already available in @code{(rpc xdr
types)} (@pxref{XDR Standard Data Types}).  Thus, we will not describe
its use further.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-struct-type base-types
Return a new XDR struct type made of a sequence of XDR data items
whose types are listed in @var{base-types}.

Struct types encode from/decode to Scheme lists whose length is that
of @var{base-types}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-vector-type base-type max-element-count
Return an object describing an XDR variable-length array of elements
of types @var{base-type} (again, an XDR type object).  If
@var{max-element-count} is a number, then it describes the maximum
number of items of type @var{base-type} that are allow in actual
arrays of this type.  If @var{base-type} is @code{#f}, then arrays of
this type may contain up to 2^32 - 1 items of type @var{base-type}.

Vector types are encoded from one-dimensional arrays such as Scheme
vectors, SRFI-4 vectors or strings (@pxref{Arrays, Guile's generalized
arrays,, guile, The GNU Guile Reference Manual}).  By default, vector
types decode to vectors, but any other kind of one-dimensional array can
be used: it only needs to be specified as the @var{vector-decoder}
argument of @code{make-xdr-basic-type} for the corresponding base type.
Of course, SRFI-4 vectors, for example, may only be used when an XDR
integer vector with a matching integer range is expected.

If @var{max-element-count} is specified and a vector to be encoded
contains more than @var{max-element-count} elements, then an
@code{&xdr-vector-size-exceeded-error} error condition is raised.
Likewise, if XDR data to be decoded describes vectors larger than
@var{max-element-count}, this error condition is raised.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-union-type discr-type discr/type-alist default-type
Return a new XDR discriminated union type, using @var{discr-type} as the
discriminant type (which must be a 32-bit basic type) and
@var{discr/type-alist} to select the ``arm'' type depending on the
discriminant value.  If no suitable value is found in @var{discr/type-alist}
and @var{default-type} is not @code{#f}, then default type is used as the arm
type.

Union types encode from/decode to Scheme pairs whose @code{car} is the
discriminant's value and whose @code{cdr} is the actual union value.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} xdr-union-arm-type union discriminant
Return the type that should be used for @var{union}'s arm given
@var{discriminant} (a Scheme value).
@end deffn

It is often useful to know the size in octets it takes to encode a
given value according to an XDR type.  However, as we just saw, the
size of some XDR types (variable-length arrays and unions) cannot be
known in advance: The encoding size depends on the actual value to
encode.  The following procedure allow the computation of the size of
the XDR representation of some value.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} xdr-type-size type value
Return the size (in octets) of @var{type} when applied to
@var{value}.  @var{type} must be an XDR type object returned by one of
the above procedures, while @var{value} should be a Scheme value
suitable for encoding with @var{type}.
@end deffn

The following section lists the standard XDR data types.


@node XDR Standard Data Types, XDR Encoding and Decoding, XDR Type Representations, Implementation of XDR
@subsection XDR Standard Data Types

All the basic data types defined by XDR are defined in the @code{(rpc
xdr types)} module.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} xdr-integer
@defvrx {Scheme Variable} xdr-unsigned-integer
@defvrx {Scheme Variable} xdr-hyper-integer
@defvrx {Scheme Variable} xdr-unsigned-hyper-integer
XDR's 32-bit and 64-bit signed and unsigned integer types.  This type
decodes to/encodes from Scheme exact numbers.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} xdr-float
@defvrx {Scheme Variable} xdr-double
32-bit and 64-bit IEEE-754 floating point numbers.  This type decodes
to/encodes from Scheme inexact numbers.  Note that XDR also defines a
``quadruple-precision floating point type'' (i.e., 128-bit long) that
is currently not available (FIXME).
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} xdr-void
@vindex %void
The ``void'' type that yields zero bits.  Any Scheme value is suitable
as an input when encoding with this type.  When decoding this type,
the @code{%void} value (which may be compared via @code{eq?}) is
returned.
@end defvr

XDR provides support for ``enumerations'', similar to that found in C.
An enumeration type maps symbols to integers and are actually encoded
as 32-bit integers.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-enumeration name enum-alist
Return an enumeration type that obeys the symbol-integer mapping
provided in @var{enum-alist} which should be a list of symbol-integer
pairs.  The returned type decodes to/encodes from Scheme symbols, as
provided in @var{enum-alist}.  Upon decoding/encoding of an
enumeration, an @code{&xdr-enumeration-error} is raised if an
incorrect value (i.e., one not listed in @var{enum-alist}) is found.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Variable} xdr-boolean
XDR's boolean type which is an enumeration.  It encodes to/decodes
from Scheme symbols @code{TRUE} and @code{FALSE}.
@end deffn

Several fixed-size and variable-size are predefined in the standard.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-fixed-length-opaque-array size
Return a fixed-length ``opaque'' array of @var{size} octets.  An
opaque array is simply a sequence of octets.

The returned XDR type object is actually an @code{<xdr-struct-type>}
object.  Thus, it encodes from/decodes to Scheme lists of exact
integers.  Conversion to a Scheme string, if needed, is left to the
user.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-variable-length-opaque-array limit
Return a variable-length opaque array.  As for
@code{make-xdr-vector-type} (@pxref{XDR Type Representations}),
@var{limit} can be either a number specifying the maximum number of
elements that can be held by the created type, or @code{#f} in which
case the variable-length array can hold up to 2^32 - 1 octets.

The returned XDR type object is actually an @code{<xdr-vector-type>}
object.  Thus, it encodes from/decodes to Scheme vectors of exact
integers.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-xdr-string limit
This is a synonym of @code{make-xdr-variable-length-opaque-array}
since XDR's string type actually represents ASCII strings, i.e.,
sequences of octets.
@end deffn

@defvr {Scheme Variable} xdr-variable-length-opaque-array
@defvrx {Scheme Variable} xdr-string
These convenience variables contain the unlimited variable-length
opaque array.
@end defvr


@node XDR Encoding and Decoding,  , XDR Standard Data Types, Implementation of XDR
@subsection XDR Encoding and Decoding

The following primitives are exported by the @code{(rpc xdr)} module.
They implement the encoding of Scheme values to XDR data types, and
the decoding of binary XDR data to Scheme values.  The exact mapping
between XDR data types and Scheme data types has been discussed
earlier.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} xdr-encode! bv index type value
Encode @var{value} (a suitable Scheme value), using XDR type
@var{type}, into bytevector @var{bv} at @var{index}.  Return the index
where encoding ended.

@var{bv} should be an R6RS bytevector large enough to hold the XDR
representation of value according to @var{type}.  To that end, users
may rely on @code{xdr-type-size} (@pxref{XDR Type Representations}).

Error conditions sub-classing @code{&xdr-error} may be raised during
encoding.  The exact exceptions that may be raised are type-dependent
and have been discussed in the previous sections.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} xdr-decode type port
Decode from @var{port} (a binary input port) a value of XDR type
@var{type}.  Return the decoded value.

Error conditions sub-classing @code{&xdr-error} may be raised during
encoding.  The exact exceptions that may be raised are type-dependent
and have been discussed in the previous sections.

@subsection Building an RPC Client

Basic building blocks for the creation of RPC clients are provided by
the @code{(rpc rpc)} module.  The easiest way to build an RPC client
is through @code{make-synchronous-rpc-call}.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-synchronous-rpc-call program version procedure arg-type result-type
Return a procedure that may be applied to a list of arguments,
transaction ID (any unsigned number representable on 32 bits), and I/O
port, to make a synchronous RPC call to the remote procedure numbered
@var{procedure} in @var{program}, version @var{version}.  On success,
the invocation result is eventually returned.  Otherwise, an error
condition is raised.  @var{arg-type} and @var{result-type} should be
XDR type objects (@pxref{XDR Type Representations}).

Error conditions that may be raised include those related to XDR
encoding and decoding (@pxref{XDR Encoding and Decoding}), as well as
RPC-specific error conditions inheriting from @code{&rpc-error} (i.e.,
conditions that pass the @code{rpc-error?} predicate).  These are
detailed in @ref{ONC RPC Message Types,
@code{assert-successful-reply}}.
@end deffn

For an example, see @ref{Creating the Client}.

@cindex batched calls
@cindex one-way calls

It is also possible to create ``one-way'' calls, i.e., RPC calls that do
not expect a reply (i.e., no return value, not even @code{void}).  This
is useful, for instance, to implement batched calls where clients do not
wait for the server to reply (@pxref{References, Section 7.4.1 of RFC
1831}).  Asynchronous calls can be implemented in terms of this, too.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-one-way-rpc-call program version procedure arg-type result-type
Similar to @code{make-synchronous-rpc-call}, except that the returned
procedure does @emph{not} wait for a reply.
@end deffn

decode RPC call messages, as well as an event loop mechanisms that
allows RPC calls to be automatically dispatched to the corresponding
Scheme handlers.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} procedure-call-information call-msg
Return an @code{<rpc-call>} object that denotes the procedure call
requested in @var{call-msg} (the result of an @code{(xdr-decode
rpc-message port)} operation).  If @var{call-msg} is not an
appropriate RPC call message, an error condition is raised.

The error condition raised may be either
@code{onc-rpc-version-mismatch-error?} or
@code{rpc-invalid-call-message-error?}.

The returned object can be queried using the @code{rpc-call-}
procedures described below.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} rpc-call-xid call
@cindex transaction ID (xid)
Return the transaction ID (``xid'' for short) of @var{call}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} rpc-call-program call
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} rpc-call-version call
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} rpc-call-procedure call
Return the program, version or procedure number of @var{call}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} rpc-call-credentials call
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} rpc-call-verifier call
Return the credentials and verifier provided by the client for
@var{call}.  FIXME: As of version @value{VERSION}, this information is
not usable.
@end deffn

The following procedures allow the description of RPC ``programs''.
Such descriptions can then be readily used to produced a full-blown
RPC processing loop.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-rpc-program number versions
Return a new object describing the RPC program identified by @var{number}
and consisting of the versions listed in @var{versions}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-rpc-program-version number procedures
Return a new object describing the RPC program version identified by
@var{number} and consisting of the procedures listed in
@var{procedures}.
@end deffn

@cindex batched calls
@cindex one-way calls

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-rpc-procedure number argument-xdr-type result-xdr-type handler [one-way?]
Return a new object describing a procedure whose number is
@var{number}, whose argument type is @var{argument-xdr-type} and whose
result type is @var{result-xdr-type} (@pxref{XDR Type
Representations}).  @var{handler} should be a one-argument procedure
that will be invoked upon reception of an RPC call for that procedure;
it will be passed the decoded argument and should return a result type
that may be encoded as @var{result-xdr-type}.

If @var{one-way?} is passed and is true, then the returned procedure is
marked as ``one-way'' (@pxref{Building an RPC Client,
@code{make-one-way-rpc-call}}).  For one-way procedures,
@code{run-stream-rpc-server} and similar procedures ignores the return
value of @var{handler} and don't send any reply when procedure
@var{number} is invoked.
@end deffn

@vindex @code{SOCK_STREAM}

Once a program, its versions and procedures have been defined, an RPC
server for that program (and possibly others) can be run using the
following procedures.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} run-stream-rpc-server sockets+rpc-programs timeout close-connection-proc idle-thunk
Run a full-blown connection-oriented (i.e., @code{SOCK_STREAM}, be it
@code{PF_UNIX} or @code{PF_INET}) RPC server for the given listening
sockets and RPC programs.  @var{sockets+rpc-programs} should be a list
of listening socket-RPC program pairs (where ``RPC programs'' are
objects as returned by @code{make-rpc-program}).  @var{timeout} should
be a number of microseconds that the loop should wait for input; when no
input is available, @var{idle-thunk} is invoked, thus at most every
@var{timeout} microseconds.  If @var{close-connection-proc} is a
procedure, it is called when a connection is being closed is passed the
corresponding @code{<stream-connection>} object.
@end deffn

While an RPC server is running over a stream-oriented transport such as
TCP using @code{run-stream-rpc-server}, its procedure handlers can get
information about the current connection and client:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} current-stream-connection
This procedure returns a @code{<stream-connection>} object describing the
current TCP connection (when within a @code{run-stream-rpc-server}
invocation).  This object can be queried with the procedures described
below.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} stream-connection? obj
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is a @code{<stream-connection>} object.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} stream-connection-port connection
Return the I/O port (@emph{not} the TCP port) for @var{connection}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} stream-connection-peer-address connection
Return the IP address of the peer/client of @var{connection}
(@pxref{Network Socket Address,,, guile, The GNU Guile Reference
Manual}).
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} stream-connection-rpc-program connection
Return the RPC program object corresponding to @var{connection}.
@end deffn

For a complete RPC server example, @ref{Creating the Server}.

@cindex I/O manager

The @code{run-stream-rpc-server} mechanism is limited to servers
managing only RPC connections, and only over stream-oriented
transports.  Should your server need to handle other input sources, a
more geneneral event handling mechanism is available.  This works by
first creating a set of @dfn{I/O managers} and then passing
@code{run-input-event-loop} a list of I/O manager-file descriptor pairs
to actually handle I/O events.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-i/o-manager exception-handler read-handler
Return an I/O manager.  When data is available for reading,
@var{read-handler} will be called and passed a port to read from; when
an exception occurs on a port, @var{exception-handler} is called and
passed the failing port.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} i/o-manager? obj
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is an I/O manager.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} i/o-manager-exception-handler manager
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} i/o-manager-read-handler manager
Return, respectively, the exception handler and the read handler of
@var{manager}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} run-input-event-loop fd+manager-list timeout idle-thunk
Run an input event loop based on @var{fd+manager-list}, a list of pairs of
input ports (or file descriptors) and I/O managers.  I/O managers are invoked
are invoked and passed the corresponding port when data becomes readable or
when an exception occurs.  I/O manager handlers can:

@itemize
@item return @code{#f}, in which case the port and I/O manager are removed
from the list of watched ports;
@item return a pair containing an input port and I/O manager, in which case
this pair is added to the list of watched ports;
@item return true, in which case the list of watched ports remains unchanged.
@end itemize

When @var{timeout} (a number of microseconds) is reached, @var{idle-thunk} is
invoked.  If timeout is @code{#f}, then an infinite timeout is assumed and
@var{idle-thunk} is never run.  The event loop returns when no watched port
is left.
@end deffn

The event loop provided by @code{run-input-event-loop} should cover a
wide range of applications.  However, it will turn out to be
insufficient in situations where tasks must be executed at specific
times, and where the interval between consecutive executions varies over
the program's lifetime.

Finally, a lower-level mechanism is available to handle a single
incoming RPC:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} serve-one-stream-request program port
Serve one RPC for @var{program}, reading the RPC from @var{port} (using
the record-marking protocol) and writing the reply to @var{port}.  If
@var{port} is closed or the end-of-file was reached, an
@code{&rpc-connection-lost-error} is raised.
@end deffn


@node ONC RPC Message Types, Record Marking Standard, Building an RPC Server, Implementation of ONC RPC
@subsection ONC RPC Message Types

@cindex @code{rpc_msg} struct type

The @code{(rpc rpc types)} module provides a representation of the
various XDR types defined in the standard to represent RPC messages
(@pxref{References}).  We only describe the most important ones as
well as procedures from the @code{(rpc rpc)} module that help use it.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} rpc-message
This variable contains a XDR struct type representing all possible RPC
messages---the @code{rpc_msg} struct type defined in RFC 1831.  By
``rpc message'' we mean the header that is transmitted before the
actual procedure argument to describe the procedure call being made.

Roughly, this header contains a transaction ID allowing clients to
match call/reply pairs, plus information describing either the call or
the reply being made.  Calls essentially contain a program, version
and procedure numbers.  Replies, on the other hand, can be more
complex since they can describe a large class of errors.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} rpc-message-type
This variable is bound to an XDR enumeration.  Its two possible values
are @code{CALL} and @code{REPLY} (both represented in Scheme using
symbols), denoting a procedure call and a reply to a procedure call,
respectively.
@end defvr

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-rpc-message xid type args ...
Return an @code{rpc-message} datum.  @var{type} should be either
@code{CALL} or @code{REPLY} (the two values of the
@code{rpc-message-type} enumeration).  The arguments @var{args} are
message-type-specific.  For example, a message denoting a procedure
call to procedure number 5 of version 1 of program 77 can be created
as follows:

@example
(define my-call-msg
  (make-rpc-message #x123 ;; the transaction ID
                    'CALL ;; the message type
                    77 1 5))
@end example

It can then be encoded in the usual way (@pxref{XDR Encoding and
Decoding}):

@example
(let* ((size (xdr-type-size rpc-message my-call-msg))
       (bv   (make-bytevector size)))
  (xdr-encode! bv 0 rpc-message my-call-msg)
  ;;; ...
  )
@end example

Likewise, a reply message denoting a successful RPC call can be
produced as follows:

@example
(make-rpc-message xid 'REPLY 'MSG_ACCEPTED 'SUCCESS)
@end example

It is worth noting that in practice, ``messages'' of type
@var{rpc-message} are followed by additional data representing either
the procedure call arguments (if the message is a @code{CALL} message)
or the procedure return value (if the message is a @code{REPLY}
message).
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} assert-successful-reply rpc-msg xid
@cindex transaction ID (xid)

Return true if @var{rpc-msg} (an RPC message as returned by a previous
@code{(xdr-decode rpc-message port)} call) is a valid reply for the
invocation labeled with transaction ID @var{xid} indicating that it
was accepted.  If @var{xid} is @code{#t}, any reply transaction ID is
accepted and it is returned (provided the rest of the message denotes
an accepted message).  On failure, an appropriate error condition is
raised.

@findex rpc-error?
@findex rpc-call-error?
The error conditions that may be raised obey @code{rpc-error?} and
@code{rpc-call-error?}.  More precisely, error conditions include the
following:

@table @code
@item rpc-program-unavailable-error?
@findex rpc-program-unavailable-error?
If @var{rpc-msg} denotes the fact that the program requested by the
corresponding RPC call is not available.

@item rpc-program-mismatch-error?
@findex rpc-program-mismatch-error?
If the corresponding RPC call requested a program version that is not
available.  The procedures
@code{rpc-program-mismatch-error:low-version} and
@code{rpc-program-mismatch-error:high-version} return, respectively,
the lowest and highest version numbers supported by the remote server.

@item rpc-procedure-unavailable-error?
@findex rpc-procedure-unavailable-error?
If the corresponding RPC call requested a procedure that is not
available.

@item rpc-garbage-arguments-error?
@findex rpc-garbage-arguments-error?
If the remote server failed to decode the procedure arguments.

@item rpc-system-error?
@findex rpc-system-error?
If the remote server failed to allocate enough memory for argument
decoding, for instance.

@end table
@end deffn


@node Record Marking Standard,  , ONC RPC Message Types, Implementation of ONC RPC
@subsection Record Marking Standard

@cindex record-marking protocol

The ONC RPC standard defines a @dfn{record-marking protocol} for
stream-oriented transport layers such as TCP whereby (1) each RPC
message is sent out as a single @dfn{record} and (2) where records may
be split into several @dfn{fragments}.  This allows implementations to
``delimit one message from another in order to detect and possibly
recover from protocol errors'' (@pxref{References, @code{RFC
1831}@comma{} Section 10}).

This protocol is implemented by the @code{(rpc rpc transports)}
module.  It is automatically used by the high-level client and server
facilities, namely @ref{Building an RPC Client,
@code{make-synchronous-rpc-call}} and @ref{Building an RPC Server,
@code{run-stream-rpc-server}}.  The available facilities are described
below.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} send-rpc-record port bv offset len
Send the RPC message of @var{len} octets encoded at offset
@var{offset} in @var{bv} (a bytevector) to @var{port}.  This procedure
sends the @var{len} octets of the record without fragmenting them.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} make-rpc-record-sender fragment-len
This procedure is a generalization of @code{send-rpc-record}.

Return a procedure that sends data according to the record marking
standard, chopping its input bytevector into fragments of size
@var{fragment-len} octets.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} rpc-record-marking-input-port port
Return a binary input port that proxies @var{port} in order to implement
decoding of the record marking standard (RFC 1831, Section 10).
@end deffn


@node Standard RPC Programs,  , Implementation of ONC RPC, API Reference
@section Standard RPC Programs

GNU Guile-RPC provides client-side and/or server-side of some commonly
found ONC RPC program, which are described below.  Currently, this is
limited to the portmapper interface, but other interfaces (e.g.,
``mount'', NFSv2) may follow.

@menu
* The Portmapper Program::      A directory of instances of RPC programs
@end menu

@node The Portmapper Program,  , Standard RPC Programs, Standard RPC Programs
@subsection The Portmapper Program

@cindex portmapper

The @code{(rpc rpc portmap)} module implements the widespread
@dfn{portmapper} RPC program defined in RFC 1833 (@pxref{References, RFC
1833@comma{} Section 3}).  As the name suggests, the portmapper
interface allows servers to be queried for the association between an
RPC service and the port it is listening to.  It also allows clients to
query the list of services registered.

@cindex @code{portmap} daemon
@cindex service discovery

In practice, most machines run a system-wide @code{portmap} daemon on
port 111 (TCP or UDP), and it is this server that is queried for
information about locally hosted RPC programs.  The @code{grpc-rpcinfo}
program is a portmapper client that can be used to query a portmapper
server (@pxref{Invoking grpc-rpcinfo, the @code{grpc-rpcinfo} tool})

Note that registering RPC programs with the portmapper is optional: it
is basically a directory mechanism that allows servers to be located
quite easily, but other existing mechanisms could be used for that
purpose, e.g., decentralized @dfn{service discovery}
(@pxref{Introduction,, service discovery with DNS-SD in Guile-Avahi,
guile-avahi, Using Avahi in Guile Scheme Programs}).

The module exports client-side procedures, as returned by
@code{make-synchronous-rpc-call} (@pxref{Building an RPC Client}), for
the various portmapper procedures.  They are listed below.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} portmapper-null arg xid port
Invoke the @code{null} RPC over @var{port}, ignoring @var{arg}, and
return @code{%void}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} portmapper-set arg xid port
Invoke the @code{set} RPC over @var{port} with argument @var{arg}.  The
invoked server should register the RPC program specified by @var{arg},
where @var{arg} must be an XDR struct (i.e., a Scheme list) containing
these four elements: the RPC program number, its version number, its
protocol and its port.  The protocol number should be one of
@code{IPPROTO_TCP} or @code{IPPROTO_UDP} (@pxref{Network Sockets and
Communication,,, guile, The GNU Guile Reference Manual}).  An XDR
boolean is returned, indicating whether the request successful.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} portmapper-unset arg xid port
Invoke the @code{unset} RPC over @var{port} with argument @var{arg}.
The invoked server should unregister the RPC program specified by
@var{arg}, where @var{arg} must have the same form as for
@code{portmapper-set}.  Again, an XDR boolean is returned, indicating
whether the request was successful.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} portmapper-get-port arg xid port
Invoke the @code{get-port} RPC over @var{port} with argument @var{arg},
which must have the same form as previously mentioned (except that its
port number is ignored).  The invoked server returns an unsigned integer
indicating the port of that RPC program.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} portmapper-dump arg xid port
Invoke the @code{dump} RPC over @var{port}, ignoring @var{arg}.  The
invoked server should return a list of 4-element lists describing the
registered RPC programs.  Those four element list are the same as for
@code{portmapper-set} and @code{portmapper-get}, namely the RPC program
number and version, its protocol and its port.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} portmapper-call-it arg xid port
Invoke the @var{call-it} procedure over @var{port}.  Quoting RFC 1833,
this procedure ``allows a client to call another remote procedure on the
same machine without knowing the remote procedure's port number''.
Concretely, it makes the portmapper invoke over UDP the procedure of the
program matching the description in @var{arg}, where @var{arg} is an XDR
struct (i.e., a Scheme list) containing an RPC program and version
number, a procedure number, and an opaque array denoting the procedure
arguments (an @code{xdr-variable-length-opaque-array}).

On success, it returns a struct consisting of the port number of the
matching program and an opaque array representing the RPC reply.  On
failure, it does not return.  Therefore, this synchronous call version
may be inappropriate.  We recommend that you do not use it.
@end deffn

The @code{portmap} module also provides convenience functions to
retrieve the symbolic name associated with common RPC program numbers.
The association between program numbers and their name is usually stored
in @file{/etc/rpc} on Unix systems and it can be parsed using the
@code{read-rpc-service-list} procedure.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} read-rpc-service-list port
Return a list of name-program pairs read from @var{port} (e.g., the
@file{/etc/rpc} file), showing the connection between an RPC program
human-readable name and its program number.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} lookup-rpc-service-name service-list program
Lookup RPC program numbered @var{program} in @var{service-list} (a list as
returned by @code{read-rpc-service-list}) and return its human-readable
name.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} lookup-rpc-service-number service-list program
Lookup RPC program named @var{program} in @var{service-list} (a list as
returned by @code{read-rpc-service-list}) and return its RPC program
number.
@end deffn
